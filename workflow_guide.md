USER WORKFLOW GUIDE

Monochrome Boutique eCommerce

1. Core UX Philosophy

Homepage = hook + brand statement

Browsing should feel editorial, not transactional

Guest shopping is first-class, not a fallback

Account creation happens after trust is built

Checkout is short, calm, and distraction-free

The user should never feel “pushed” — only guided.

2. Primary User Types
1️⃣ Guest User (Default)

Can browse all products

Can add to cart

Can checkout (Cash on Delivery)
